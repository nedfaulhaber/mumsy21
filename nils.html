        <p>This mix is full of "happy accidents" and "extraordinary coincidences" from a year that seemed to bring me music on a platter and said "in case you miss it, we'll just keep putting it in your face". German composer Nils Frahm is such an artist.</p>
        <p>A classical, ambient, and electronic artist, Frahm's sparse and beautiful minimalism requires some very active listening. When you give it the time and attention it deserves, it will blow you away. Incidentally, there is a Nils Frahm song on your 2019 mix, right after I had just discovered him and seen him perform live at one of the best shows I have seen (and will ever see). My excitement has never abated regarding Frahm's brilliant composition; quite the contrary, I've gathered together his entire catalogue and immersed myself in it fully.</p>
        <p>Frahm and I collided when I randomly discovered him on SoundCloud one day at work. It soon became hard for me to concentrate and I realized that I would need to listen at home with wide open, focused ears. I had a haircut only a few days later. My stylist, who is a musician, and I love to talk about music. And what do you know, he had just been to Berlin and was describing this incredible moment where he heard the music of someone named Nils Frahm! When I went nuts about how much I had been listening to him after JUST finding Frahm, he told me that Frahm was coming  to Portland in just a couple of months. Jason (my stylist) and I went to the show with some of his friends.</p>
        <p>The beautiful "coincidences" continued when at work the next week, a guy came up to me, introduced himself as Daylon, and said, "Hey, I think I saw you at the Nils Frahm show." He had never heard Frahm before that, and now he too was totally enamored. We talked about Frahm and the show for a long time at the water cooler, and became fast work friends. To this day, Daylon (who is a writer) gives me book recommendations, despite having left the company last summer.</p>
        <p>This song, "Says" is from a live album from the tour that Jason, Daylon, and I all witnessed. It falls short (way short) of capturing the experience, but it definitely gives a great idea of what it was like musically. This one will require some quiet listening, best done while doing nothing BUT listening. It will be rewarding, I hope!!</p>
