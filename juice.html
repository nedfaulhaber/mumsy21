        <p>Two mixes ago on your 2018 Mother's Day mix, I included SoundCloud "emo" rapper Lil Uzi Vert. Since that time, that genre has been decimated by tragedy. Uzi is damn near the only major figure of the genre remaining. An alarm has begun to sound at this point after yet another death - the drug overdose of SoundCloud rapper Juice WRLD late last December.</p>
        <p>SoundCloud rappers, despite obvious stylistic differences, share a few key things: an emotional openness on their records regarding their unstable mental health, the simultaneous traditonal rap brags mixed with totally un-rap vulnerability, and their multi-genre fluidity (often not really rap at all). Perhaps the most obvious thing they share is their young age - 16 to 21 years of age and already being famous, going from SoundCloud rags to major label riches. Many are clearly not ready, much like young NBA stars, and make some very poor choices.</p>
        <p>Unlike many young sports and acting stars, most teen musicians don't have anyone from the business watching over them. If they don't have involved, strong families, they have no one but friends and hangers-on making the same bad choices. Managers are in the background and generally hands off, and there is no system built in to provide any therapy to deal with the sudden onset of fame and the money and drugs that come with it. In contrast to the microscope placed on athletes and teen actors, and the criticism of their questionable actions, this self-destructive behavior is pretty much expected and almost encouraged among popular musicians. Considering the rash of rock musician overdose deaths in 1970 and '71, this has been a long-running theme, and the current spate of SoundCloud rapper deaths is getting compared to that era. I highly suggest listening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/arts/music/popcast-juice-wrld.html" target="_blank">this podcast from The New York Times</a>, where this is discussed at length surrounding Juice's death and the death of Lil Peep (and the documentary that came out recently about his short life).</p>
        <p>The song on this mix, "Fast", is chilling in that Juice is almost prophetic about what's coming. Lyrics like "I been living fast, fast, fast, fast / Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad" and "I get high as a bitch, still the same dude I was back then, and now I'm lost and confused" sound like a cry for help, but into the void. This portion, though, is perhaps the most sad and sums up the experience of the life of the SoundCloud rapper:</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I go through so much, I'm 19 years old</p>
        <p>It's been months since I felt at home</p>
        <p>But it's okay 'cause I'm rich</p>
        <p>Psych, I'm still sad as a bitch</p>
