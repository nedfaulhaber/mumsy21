        <p>Aaron Funk is a true original. The Winnipeg native was largely responsible for creating an entirely new genre of electronica known as "breakcore", an assaulting mix of intensely complex beats, heavy use of odd samples, and a heavy dose of "found" sound and noise. Much like experimental composer John Cage and Icelandic multi-genre artist Björk before him, Funk was fascinated by sounds that other people would consider simply un-musical noise. His sound was sculpted early on when he gravitated toward the use of "non-instruments" to make his beats. "I'd use garbage bins and streetlights and anything else I could find that was hollow or metallic to bang out rhythms on," Funk recalls.</p>
        <p>When Funk (like Cage and Björk) discovered the world of electronic media such as computers, synths, and samplers, he never looked back. He hunkered down and cranked out music like a mad man, and came up with his artist name Venetian Snares after "...writing a track with really fast snare rolls that sounded like scraping a stick across a grate or running a pencil down venetian blinds in a distracted classroom".</p>
        <p>He released a flurry of tapes and early EPs, followed by his first full album in 2001. His off-color, crass titles matched his wild, jarring "breakcore" music; his 2005 album title's homage to his hometown, for instance, was called <em>Winnipeg is a Frozen Shithole</em>. It was around this time that Funk took a trip to Hungary, which inspired him to make what would become his most influential, ground-breaking album, <em>Rossz Csillag Alatt Született</em>. The record showcased his deep interest in contemporary classical music and odd time signatures. For instance, one of the songs from the album was in 7/4 time, unheard of in the world of electronic beats prior to that, and still extremely rare.</p>
        <p>His experimentations and nerd-like intensity led him down many more paths beyond his original breakthrough sounds. He became obsessed with modular analog synthesizers, the synths used by the earliest experimenters before keyboards were ever utilized as a vehicle for playing. Stacked like massive computer servers, the sound is controlled by plugging and unplugging wires and working directly with electrical currents (something I know very little about, but Maya does - she has a small modular synth of her own that she saved up for). Funk released a 2015 album entirely created with these modular synths called <em>Traditional Synthesizer Music</em>.</p>
        <p>In other experimentations, he worked painstakingly with haunting synth sounds of all kinds, dipping into a world of beauty that he had only hinted at prior. The "Glass Version" of "Your Face When I Finally" is just such an example. Funk took the basic melody of a much more uptempo, intensely beat driven opener from the album and used it as a closer. The icy, "glassy" sound of the synths resulted in this delicate, sans beat version here on your mix. Not exactly indicative of his overall pantheon of work, it is nonetheless a testament to his wide musical palette and adventurous nature.</p>
