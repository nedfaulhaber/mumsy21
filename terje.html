        <p>Todd Terje was one of those instances of synchronicity that make it seem like something was simply <em>meant</em> to happen. At work one day, someone posted a SoundCloud track, a very cool remix of the Dolly Parton song "Jolene" by a Norwegian electronic music producer, Todd Terje. I planned on listening to more of his stuff that evening after work, but ended up not being able to, and a couple of days went by, when all of a sudden G$ posts an album by...Todd Terje! And he said that he'd been getting really into Terje for about a month. Conicidence? A happy one!</p>
        <p>On that record (<em>It's Album Time</em>) was a song that jumped out at me while I was listening to the album in the background one day, while cleaning. Was that Bryan Ferry's voice? You may know Ferry from the 70's art pop group Roxy Music, or from the 1980's, when he scored a minor hit called "Slave To Love". <img class="ferry" src="img/bryanferry.png" alt="Bryan Ferry sings onstage">Ferry's been a hero in the world of new wave for decades, and so it totally surprised me that he was on this obscure record by a guy I had only just heard of, and who nobody besides G$ and the guy from work seemed to know. But when you hear Terje's music, you realize quickly that his stuff is more than fit for any number of legends to sing on.</p>
        <p>"Johnny and Mary" is a cover of an old Robert Palmer song (the guy who did "Addicted To Love" in the mid-80s), and one of those instances where to me, the cover version outshines the original. In Terje's version, the beautiful melancholy of the music along with the breathy fragile Ferry vocal part tells a story almost by itself, even without Palmer's lyrics. Those are great as well, with their sad story, seemingly about an artist past his prime, or perhaps never was successful, and the partner who quietly tolerates his eccentricities and sad moods.</p>
        <p><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-album-time/806267243" target="_blank">The rest of the album</a> is peppered with all kinds of fun twists and turns - at times Latin, other times loungy, sometimes art rock, and even some jazz fusion thrown in. It's a true treasure well worth listening to!</p>
