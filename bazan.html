        <p>The first few times I listened to "Wolves At The Door", I was busy with other tasks and didn't bother looking to see what year the song came out. From the theme of the song, I assumed it was during the Trump era. Nope. All the way back in 2011...a good reminder of how long the Republican party has been targeting poor, white evangelical Christians in the heartland of America. Sometimes I can forget about the frustrations we had as these bozo conservatives in Congress blocked every bit of Obama legislation they possibly could, and then there was the W. administration, and Gingrich, and Buchanan. Ugh.</p>
        <p>"Wolves At The Door" makes all of that worth reliving, in some small sense, because the song is so good, and the lyrics are so spot-on. David Bazan manages to encapsulate the whole ugly dynamic that eventually elected Trump within a very small amount of lyrics. Always amazing to me when a songwriter can do so much with so little - and less is usually more when it comes down to the quality.</p>
        <p>The other thing that had me convinced that this was a Trump-era song was the chorus, which is very clearly from the point of view of a family member or friend of this tragic, brainwashed, hoodwinked conservative guy. And the family member or friend clearly is a liberal, or at least someone who is intelligent enough not to get duped by the Republicans and their agenda. "You're a goddamn fool, and I love you". Somehow managing to hold both things at once - this is the plight I see with Ganyoon and his parents (especially his dad), and I feel so lucky not to have to go through that.</p>
        <p>David Bazan really nails this tragedy with that lyric; most likely because he himself had a hard break from the Christian faith back in 2006. Prior to that, his project Pedro the Lion was ostensibly Christian indie rock, but the lyrics were complicated, human, and often described the ongoing struggles and challenges of many of the faithful as they navigate the complexity of the world. The lyrics felt secular in many ways, and half of his fans were secular. But he shocked his Christian fans when he ended the Pedro project, went solo, and denounced the Church. In his own words, he had watched it be "co-opted by authoritarianism". Most of his family, his parents included, and many of his friends remained Christian, so splitting with the Church meant driving a wedge in between those relationships. No wonder he so deftly captures all of the pain and sorrow and anguish of this dynamic in just 8 words. You can read about his struggles and redemptions, and everything in between, in this <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/18/20961543/david-bazan-interview-strange-negotiations-pedro-lion" "target= _blank">very cool interview.<a/></p>
