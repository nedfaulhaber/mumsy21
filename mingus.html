        <p>Bass player and composer Charles Mingus is a guy who deserves to be on that civil rights mix of yours! Combative as a person, innovative as a musician, Mingus was outspoken about Black rights for his entire career. So many of his song titles and themes have to do with Black history and the continued fight for equal rights that has of course never stopped, but was at a fevered pitch in the 1960's when Mingus was composing most of his classic works.</p>
        <p>Upright bass players who play jazz music typically list Charles Mingus right at the top in terms of their favorite bass players of all time. Maybe I'm just overly influenced by what my old teacher Dan Schulte believed, but I have never felt that his style was a good fit for me, probably because I'm not a giant man with enormous hands and a ferocity like a bull! For me, Mingus is much more than a bass player. He's a guy whose music transcends being a "player's player", sort of like Miles Davis or John Coltrane. I was able to get very into Charles Mingus long before I even knew much about jazz at all, let alone how to play it or how to play an upright bass.</p>
        <p>My intro to Mingus was while I was at Indiana, and "II B.S." was the song that lit a fire for me. With that said, it would not surprise me if this is on an old cassette tape mix for a birthday long long ago! So this could very well be a repeat, but a good one at that. Maybe a different context will give it a freshness! The song's like a bucking bronco or a runaway train and it's classic Mingus - yelling in the background like a rider whipping his horse's behind to go faster, faster, faster. So much of Mingus' music (especially live) has that intense, stomping sort of feel, something like gospel music whipping a church crowd into a frenzy. It's easy to see why it would be attractive to people on a musical level completely outside of the skill and knowledge base of a complex artform. And unlike a lot of jazz for the uninitiated - Mingus will not tolerate being background music!</p>
        <p>There's a whole other side to Mingus' music as well; as a total worshiper of Duke Ellington (he tried and failed to make Ellington's group), he also wrote lush big band compositions with full arrangements including more "refined" instruments such as the oboe. I always feel like they could easily be the soundtrack for a film noir, where the femme fatale walk into the room for the first time. You can find much of this style of music on the very record that spawned "II B.S." - the hilariously named <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/mingus-mingus-mingus-mingus-mingus/1444104538" target="_blank"><em>Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus</em></a>.
