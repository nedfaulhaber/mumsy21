        <p>I came across the French artist Oklou (Marylou Maniel) during 2018 while listening to SoundCloud at work. How I ended up finding it is a mystery to me now, but a song called "They Can't Hear Me" somehow ended up on my screen and into my headphones. I really loved it - the delicate nature of her wispy vocals, and especially the production, which was pretty low budget but had some great sounds, a phasing vocal effect, and a powerful bass punch on the chorus.</p>
        <p>I tried finding more by Oklou, but when I went to her SoundCloud profile page, there was just the one EP, with another 3 songs on it, none of which grabbed me in the same way as "They Can't Hear Me". I shared the song with work mates and friends, and then moved on to new horizons, as usual.</p>
        <p>Then, in 2020, I heard a mix from a DJ who I particularly love, Avalon Emerson. Included in the mix of electronic dance music was a dance mix of an Oklou song I had never heard before. Emerson is such a fantastic collector of music that it didn't surprise me to see that she would have a lesser known artist like Oklou in the mix, but it also made me wonder if perhaps Oklou had made some new material that was more readily available. I decided to search Spofity, and sure enough, she was releasing singles for what would eventually be the mixtape <em>Galore</em>. A number of those songs featured collaborations with musicians who I really admire - the likes of AG Cook, EASYFUN, and Casey MQ - and there was a single, not on the mixtape, that also struck my eye, because it too featured a fantastic producer, Mura Masa. It was the song "Entertnmnt", which quickly became one of my favorites of 2020, and a big favorite here in the household.</p>
        <p>Soon, Amy and Maya were also adding Oklou songs to our family playlists, and I began to see her name elsewhere online, including some great singles and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrZnd92WFY0" target="_blank">fantastic live performance on "COLORS"</a>, where musicians of all stripes perform stripped down versions of some of their songs in a large, empty room painted floor to wall to ceiling in a single color that the showrunners choose to encapsulate what they see as the vibe of the artist. And then I heard her on a fantastic record (<em>Good Luck</em>) by Swedish musician Bladee and producer Mechatok on a remix of the song "Rainbow". This put her in the company of superstar Charli XCX, who also guested on a remix on the album. One of my favorite albums of 2021 (it actually came out in Dec 2020), it was loaded with excellent songs, and that Oklou version of "Rainbow" was right in the top 3.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to hear more from Oklou in 2022. Her output has been a little uneven, but the songs that hit REALLY hit! I feel like she's capable of crafting a masterwork of an album at some point.</p>
