        <p>Lana Del Rey is one of those artists that inspires a lot of strong opinions. Her loyal fans find her emotionally raw lyrics and forlorn vocals therapeutic and cathartic, and relate on a personal level to her art in a way that transcends a typical fan-artist relationship. On the flip side, Del Rey has plenty of detractors who find her music to be overwrought, pretentious, and contrived, essentially just a one-trick-pony "sad girl" trying to jerk tears from eyes.</p>
        <p>This divide goes deeper than just her music, though. Del Rey (born Elizabeth Grant) has been at the center of controversy for her entire career. Her bluntness and take-no-shit attitude have made her plenty of enemies - she's been called anti-feminist, fake, and full of herself. But the flip side is that Del Rey has done things her way, with unapologetically personal lyrics and an "open book" attitude that can be viewed as quite the opposite - her willingness to express sadness, admit weakness, and produce art without concern for political correctness can be seen as symbolic of a powerful woman.</p>
        <p>No matter where people stood on the subject of Lana Del Rey, her critically acclaimed, Grammy-nominated 2019 album <em>Norman Fucking Rockwell!</em> was a record that was so well done, so mature in its conception, and so engagingly intimate that it bridged the divide, maybe not all the way, but definitely more than any of her prior work. Stripped down instrumentally and with subtle but brilliant production by Jack Antonoff, the record also features perhaps Del Rey's best lyrics ever. The songs paint pictures and tell stories in the vein of Tom Waits or Joni Mitchell, but with the melancholia that is purely Lana.</p>
        <p>This song is a perfect example - achingly beautiful, heartbreaking and dark but with a pinch of hope at the very end, with just a piano and Lana's voice. The emotional build at the end of the song is punctuated by a change in vocal register and an added lyrical phrase - "but I have...it" that is a true invitation to get choked up, to shed a tear of sadness or redemption, or both.</p>
