        <p>Some people assume that country star Maren Morris is just another pretty face in Nashville, but that couldn't possibly be further from the truth. These same people are most likely men, especially male country fans who prescribe to the infamous quote from country radio consultant Keith Hill in 2015 that women are the "tomatoes of our salad" garnishing the "lettuce" male artists. This became known as "tomato-gate" among most country fans, especially the female country music artists who were sick and tired of not getting their music played on mainstream radio.</p>
        <p>It's fitting that Morris' self-released EP came out the same year, spawning her breakthrough hit single "My Church". Morris, a native of Arlington, TX, was given a guitar at age 12 and has never looked back. She began writing and recording songs at only 15 years of age, crafting enough music to release two full length albums before graduating college in 2010. Neither record got much traction in terms of a recording/performing career, but her songwriting was noticed in Nashville and she spent some years writing songs for major country artists like Tim McGraw.</p>
        <p>It was the aforementioned EP that changed everything for Morris. It exploded on Spotify and soon she was signed to a record contract. The single "My Church" went all the way to #5 on the country charts. The success led to her releasing her huge major label debut <em>Hero</em> in early 2016. Anything but just a "tomato", Morris wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, and co-produced it. The song on this mix ("Sugar") has what I consider one of the tightest, most well-written pop choruses I've ever heard. It's flawlessly smooth in transition, triumphant in its melody and harmony, insanely catchy, and so lyrically clever (the sugar metaphor is really played up, but without being cheesy at all).</p>
        <p>Since that time, Morris has toured extensively, released a second major album, written and performed a song to support victims and family members of the Las Vegas shooting, and more. Last year, she became 1/4 of an all-women country group called The Highwomen, continuing to fight against the notion that women are only garnish on a male country music salad.</p>
