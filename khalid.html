        <p>When you talk about El Paso's Khalid Robinson, you are talking about the quintessential example of hitting the ground running. At the tender age of only 18, Khalid (who goes as an artist by his first name only) released his very first single, "Location", and it promptly went to #16 on the Billboard charts. Since then the song has been certified quadruple platinum in sales. In just a few short years, he has racked up six Grammy nominations, had a number one album, charted multiple top singles, and been given the key to the city of El Paso.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly grounded and mature for a man of his age, Khalid has been a non-stop presence in modern music, sprinkling pixie dust over countless hits in collaborations with artists such as EDM DJ Marshmello, with whom he recorded "Silence", a single which became quintuple platinum in Australia and topped the dance charts all over the world. He appears on the <em>Black Panther</em> soundtrack with rapper Swae Lee, the hit "Lovely" with Billie Eilish, and the record-breaking 30 weeks-on-the-charts Benny Blanco hit "Eastside", a duet with pop star Halsey.</p>
        <p>His second full length album, 2019's <em>Free Sprit</em>, went directly to Number One on the charts and spawned the massive hit single "Talk", which he performed on <a href="https://www.metatube.com/en/videos/428870/Khalid-Talk-Live-SNL/" target="_blank"><em>Saturday Night Live.</em></a>
        <p>The song on this mix happens to be my favorite on the album, though "Talk" was a close second! I love "My Bad" for the finger picked jazzy guitar and Khalid's diving and dipping vocal rhythms on the chorus. Truth is, you really can't go wrong with Khalid because the man can sing like an angel. Once you get acquainted with his voice, you'll be hearing it all over the place - shopping, at restaurants, on other people's songs, and blasting out of car windows. But to me, "My Bad" is a perfect song to start with.</p>
