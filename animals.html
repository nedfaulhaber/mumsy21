        <p>While Chloe Moriondo and Ã¶sterreich were a gift of sorts from the kids, Animals As Leaders was a bit of a loop. A decade or so ago, I ended up with this band on a list of things to listen to that I keep on my phone. Who gave me the tip I don't recall, but I ended up listening to them quite a bit while living down near Grandma Joanie for that brief period of time in deep SW Portland. I eventually stopped listening, not because I didn't like the band, but because as things go for me, even before the streaming era, I was constantly being introduced to new music.</p>
        <p>Animals As Leaders could be called anything from "math rock" to "prog rock" to "technical metal", and for me fit nicely into the lineage of such bands that began with Rush. Not coincidentally, most of the members of these modern math/prog rock groups cite Rush as an influence. In the late 90's, Collin Jordan introduced me to Don Caballero, a 3-piece instrumental group that was the first band I ever heard labeled as "math". A string of such bands followed, including such instrumental groups as Covet (see your 2019 mix made by Maya and me) - led by Yvette Young (see your 2020 mix). So the fact that I've continued to listen to this genre has kept Spotify and Apple busy feeding me new releases.</p>
        <p>Sometime during 2021, one of those new releases was from Animals As Leaders. I recognized the name immediately, but couldn't recall much about the group other than that they were instrumental prog/math rockers and they played 8-string guitars. The new release ("Monomyth") was incredible, and I jumped back in, especially excited because I knew how into Japanese math rock Maya had become, and figured this group would be up her alley (and not Japanese!). I discovered that they did indeed play 8-string guitars, but also that they didn't even have a bass player at all, and were in fact only 3 guys. The low strings of these bizarre instruments, if played correctly, sound exactly like a slapped electric bass, and here I was back in the day thinking they had a bass player. Fooled me! I also discovered something really cool, which was that the racial makeup of the band was unique to most prog rock groups. The leader is a Nigerian-American named Tosin Abasi, a pioneer of the 8-string guitar and probably the best in the world at playing it. Right next to him is Javier Reyes, a Latino. The drummer, Matt Garstka, fits the typical white dude stereotype, but in this case that's the minority. This brings me back again to Moses Sumney, who also defies the racial stereotypes when it comes to his music as well.</p>
        <p>I decided to put "Monomyth" on a family playlist, and I was surprised that Maya didn't really comment on it. This is where the song on your mix, "Physical Education", comes in. After that playlist was "released" within the family, when I was enjoying rediscovering the group and learning more, I discovered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSNtwIB0FGA" target="_blank">live 2020 (no crowd, pandemic-style) performance of "Physical Education"</a> that I knew would get Maya interested, if she wasn't quietly so already. Seeing them play the 8-string guitars and how tight the band is should be remarkable for anyone with an interest in music, even someone who may not enjoy theirs. She replied with a simple "Cool!", but when the next playlist came around the following month, she had THREE Animals As Leaders songs on there! Ever since that time, I think to Amy and Mo's chagrin (haha), Maya has put Animals As Leaders songs on a lot of playlists.</p>
