        <p>It's Billie Eilish. What can I say about her that hasn't already been said? The 18 year old superstar has taken over the pop music world in just about every way; she's living the dream of every teenager, perhaps more than any teen could really dream of. She's the banner carrier for Gen Z fashion and coolness but simultaneously in Vogue magazine and critically acclaimed by adults twice her age or more. She has already won 5 Grammy Awards - not only the youngest artist to ever win in the big categories, but the second artist EVER (of any age) to win them all in one year. It's reminiscent of a young tennis champion who's just blowing away the field before even finishing school. And what's more, she seems to be a really cool person, raised by a quiet, quirky set of parents who sleep in the living room so that Billie and her brother Finneas (who co-writes and produces Billie's music) can use their bedroom for a music studio.</p>
        <p>My personal experience with Billie Eilish was sort of like seeing a train from a long way off and then watching it pick up speed, until before I knew it it had blown past me. At the start of 2019, I was listening to the New York Times Music podcast, and chief music critic Jon Pareles was talking about how his personal pick for an artist to watch in 2019 was Billie Eilish. She was already very popular among fans, but he felt that with each new release she was putting out, the music was getting more and more interesting and original, and she was really coming into her own as a singer and performer. Boy was he ever right!</p>
        <p>I'd never heard of her, but listening to bits and pieces of some of her songs on the podcast, I was pretty impressed. Then I just went on with my Billie-less day to day life, until some co-workers started to post some of the songs from her <em>Don't Smile At Me</em> EP. I then heard the my girls start talking about how they hated "Billie Eyelash" (as they and their friends referred to her as a "burn"). I was pretty shocked that middle schoolers weren't into Billie, and they were even more shocked that I knew who she was and that I really liked her music! Needless to say, within a month, when Billie Eilish's massive 2019 album <em>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</em> arrived on the scene, they and their friends were singing a very different tune about Billie (no more Eyelash). It was probably the number one most requested and played album in the car on our backpacking adventures last summer!</p>
        <p>"everything i wanted" is a single that was released in 2019 after the release of her album, and for this mix, I wavered between it and the haunting "I Love You" from <em>When We All...</em>. In the end I settled on this one because I think it shows the more unique side of Billie and Finneas' music, with its lush and warm keyboards, subtle bits of vocals bouncing around quietly, and the click-clacking beats and bouncy boxiness of the persistent arpeggiator bassline. I think that the other song is incredible live, so you can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6AdQLB_19g" target="_blank">this performance with her brother on SNL</a> and get a two for one Billie deal!</p>
