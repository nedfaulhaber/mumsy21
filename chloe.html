        <p>Chalk this one up to my kids again! While Maya was the influencer with "Rakuen No Kimi", it was Mo who led me to "What If It Doesn't End Well" by Chloe Moriondo. When we started doing family playlists in mid 2020, Mo introduced me to the music of Cavetown, whom they were obsessed with at the time (and who can be heard on your mix from last year). Cavetown is a key player in the Gen Z queer singer songwriter scene, a scene that is chock full of amazing artists, and though Mo's main contributions were Cavetown songs, they also had some others - Girl in Red, Conan Gray, and Chloe Moriondo.</p>
        <p>Moriondo is a true Gen Z'er, in that they got their start self-releasing music through their YouTube channel, and is still as widely known as being a YouTuber as much as a musical artist. At that time, Moriondo was mainly known as a uke playing singer songwriter, and their songs didn't really jump out at me. But then one day in 2021, while doing a NY Times crossword on Amy's laptop, I happened to catch a glimpse of music super-critic Jon Caramonica's headline, reviewing (positively) two new albums by young queer artists; Moriondo was one of them (Girl in Red was the other). I spent the next couple of days listening to Moriondo's new album, entitled <em>Blood Bunny</em>, and I was really impressed by the musical breadth versus what I had heard previously from Mo. Meanwhile, Mo was also listening fervently to <em>Blood Bunny</em>, and quickly becoming obsessed with it!</p>
        <p>When the next family playlist hit, Mo had a couple of songs from the record, and then I surprised them (and Amy and Maya) by my own Moriondo contribution - "What If It Doesn't End Well". The last song on the album, their deep, warm vocal and sparse guitar grabbed my attention, and then its anthemic ending stopped me in my tracks.</p>
        <p>Mo went up to Seattle in the fall with their best friend Ia (and Ia's mom) to see Moriondo in concert. I learned from them that Chloe was only 19 years old, and watching the video that Mo took of some of the show, Moriondo did indeed look like a teenager. Both Mo and I noted how delighted they seemed to be on stage touring (they live in Detroit, with their parents) in the Pacific NW, and getting such an adoring crowd to come see them.</p>
        <p>Interestingly enough, by the time of our big Top 40 countdown at New Years Eve, where everyone submits their favorite 10 songs from our playlists for that year, Mo had become interested in some other artists, and were it not for me, Chloe Moriondo would've been entirely absent from the Top 40. As it turned out, my submission of "What If It Doesn't End Well" put Moriondo squarely in the Top Ten, where they most certainly belonged (in my humble opinion).</p>
