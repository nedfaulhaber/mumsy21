        <p>I will chalk this one up to the wonders of having teenagers who become their own people and develop their own tastes, and then introduce you to something you would've otherwise never known about. (Hopefully this is how you feel about <em>your</em> children's mixes hehehe!). Maya's interest in anime has had less impact on me in terms of the art, the stories, and the vast and seemingly bottomless well of culture that surrounds it, than it has with its music. She began to include quite a few songs from anime soundtracks in 2021, and then proceeded down a path of Japanese progressive (prog) rock that led into other Japanese versions of American musical styles.</p>
        <p>"Rakuen No Kimi" came and went pretty quickly in terms of how much she focused on it, in comparison with other songs by other artists that introduced entire discographies into our monthly family mixes. The manga (this is the video version of anime, which is in print) series that brought this song to her attention is <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, still one of her favorites (as can be guessed by the poster of it on her wall). This track played at the end of every episode of the final season of the series. In the manga/anime community, it seems that there's a lot of anticipation regarding what the intro and outro music will be each season, so "Raken No Kimi" was in rarefied air.</p>
        <p>This song cemented itself in my brain and just grew and grew on me. Maya had sort of moved on - still liked the song, presumably, but was down the path that it led her to. Amy and Mo actively disliked the song; Amy felt that it sounded like a musical theater singer trying to do pop rock. So it was me who really latched on to this one (somewhat surprisingly to everyone, though I don't know why).</p>
        <p>My first question was "who is österreich?" and why would a Japanese artist (band?) name themselves something Germanic like this? I was never able to discover why the Austrian name, but I did discover that the man behind the name is Kunimitsu Takahashi, a former member of Japanese rock band "the cabs". Due largely to his own mental health issues, the band broke up in 2013, freeing Takahashi up to start his own project, which became österreich. "Raken No Kimi" was not his first song given the honor of being a key track for <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>. His breakthrough song for his solo project was "Monou", the opening theme for the second season of the show.</p>
        <p>Takahashi continues to create music under the österreich name, utilizing other musicians to play the parts that he does for the recordings. I haven't delved too far into it, but my hope would be that I would find music that moves me the way that "Rakuen No Kimi" does. In the end, I feel lucky to have two kids who are now hipping me to music I've never heard before - I've been hoping this day would come, and it's here!</p>
