        <p>When it comes to tongue-in-cheek, Kate Hollowell has hers firmly placed. It's even in the project name, let alone the music. Take, for instance, her punk band Slut Island, and her solo moniker Number One Popstar. The latter project is a recent solo venture, spurred on by the pandemic and the 2020 hard quarantine. Artists of every stripe have put out records in late 2020 and 2021 that were a direct product of being stuck inside and unable to tour. Many have said it was actually refreshing to have that lack of pressure, and the lack of the energy drain of performing.</p>
        <p>For Hollowell, it was apparently just a deep need to replace the energy of touring - an overflow of energy that had to get put somewhere. An actor, a director, a dancer, a musician, a humorist, Hollowell says she embraced the pandemic and just began writing songs. In her words, she and her boyfriend "basically turned our home into a 24/7 recording studio during quarantine." Rather than write punk music, Hollowell decided to go for something danceable, extremely poppy, and light. But her lyrics were dripping with satire in this new project just as much as they were in Slut Island.</p>
        <p>That humor was a big part of what drew me to this song when Amy put it on a family playlist last year. I loved the simple synthpop beat and hook, but her obviously non-number-one-popstar production was enough to make me laugh in conjunction with the name. The lyrics came later for me, and even then, there was the next layer of the satire - the more hardcore punk message - of criticizing the reduction of women to their bodies by patriarchal society.</p>
        <p>So, much like with Maya and Mo with their contributions to my music listening, this one goes out to Amy!</p>
