        <p>Born in Germany in 1992, pop artist Kim Petras was originally famous for her MTF gender transition. Touted at the time as the "world's youngest transsexual", she was all the rage in the German media after appearing at the age of 13 on German TV to openly discuss being transgender. She and her family lobbied publicly for transgender rights, resulting in international media coverage, and a certain degree of celebrity for Petras in her home country, where she became a model for a chain of hair salons. In 2008, she announced that she had completed her hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery, at the age of 16. Like Maya and other transgender people, she said that when she was asked by the media whether after her transition she felt like a woman, she responded that "the truth is I have always felt like a woman â€“ I just ended up in the wrong body."</p>
        <p>Today, it is her music that makes Petras a celebrity. Though she will gladly discuss her life as a transgender person and is active in the transgender rights movement, her gender is not the focus. Instead, it is her artistry that dominates the headlines and discussion surrounding her music. She began releasing singles in 2008, followed in the next 8 years by a slew of features on other artists' songs. In 2013, she connected with a number of producers, including Aaron Joseph, who has continued to work with Petras to this day and toured with her on her recent 2019/2020 Clarity Tour. By the end of 2013, she was consistently named as one of the rising stars of the future of pop music.</p>
        <p>It was in 2017 that things began to really blow up for Petras. Her debut single "I Don't Want It At All" was a huge hit on the Internet, and soon she was at the top of everyone's list of best new pop artists. Her association with superstar Charli XCX and appearance on Charli's hit "Unlock It" from <em>Pop 2</em>, followed by a string of successful singles, proved the hype correct, and by 2018's Halloween-inspired EP <em>Turn Off the Light</em>, she had fully come into her own as a sensation and major player in the pop world.</p>
        <p>2019 was a big year for Petras. Working with a bigger budget for production, she slowly released single after single for what would eventually become her first full length album, <em>Clarity</em>. The album was a hit among fans and garnered her many new ones. After following it with a full length version of <em>Turn Off the Light</em> with 9 new songs, she announced the Clarity Tour, her first major tour as the featured act. Maya and I went when she came Portland for the third show of the tour, and it was a truly incredible performance by a confident and talented Petras, both in terms of stage presence as well as vocal chops.</p>
        <p>The song on this mix, the title track of the 2019 album by the same name, is both the first song on the record and was the opener on her tour. Her confidence is on full display, and for me, the lyric "I'm a rarity, I got clarity" sounds like the words of an artist who has truly arrived and is a symbol for transgender pride.</p>
