        <p>Born in 1929 in NYC to Puerto Rican parents, Ray Barretto grew up to the big band sounds of Duke Ellington and Count Basie, thanks to his mother's feverish love for jazz. It wasn't until he heard Dizzy Gillespie's song "Manteca", however, that he realized that Latin music could be an integral part of jazz music. A conga player himself, Barretto was blown away by Gillespie's conga player, the Cubano Chano Pazo, and vowed that he would one day be a jazz artist himself. This was a vow he most certainly ended up keeping.</p>
        <p>In the late 40's and early 50's, Barretto frequented jazz jams all over the city and was recognized by the likes of Charlie Parker and Tito Puente. It was with Puente that he got his big break, playing with the master for four years. Soon, Barretto was inspiring young conga players to play jazz the same way Pazo had inspired him.</p>
        <p>By the 60's, with Latin music hitting a peak of popularity with non-Latino audiences, he became the house conga player for the 3 biggest jazz labels in the industry. Soon, he formed his own group and began to explore new Latin styles such as pachanga and boogaloo. Barretto soon began to help define the genres, and scored a major pachanga hit in 1962, "El Watusi".</p>
        <p>His exploration of the boogaloo style led him to create the quintessential Latin album of the era, <em>Acid</em>, in 1968. Full of the expressive singing of lead vocalist Adelberto Santiago, chugging Latin grooves, and Barretto's deep experience with jazz, blues, and Latin styles, the album spawned the hit "A Deeper Shade of Soul", which crossed over beyond Latin audiences and has become the most enduring boogaloo song ever.</p>
        <p>The song on this mix, the title track "Acid", became another enduring song, not so much as a radio hit or pop culture phenomenon, but as a go-to classic of early salsa music. If you learn salsa dancing, this song will likely be the song you will take your first steps to. Its deep step-step-pause rhythm defined the genre and is still used as the bedrock of Latin dance. The groove is absolutely infectious and a listener is hard-pressed not to move!</p>
