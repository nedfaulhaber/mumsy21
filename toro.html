        <p>Toro y Moi's 2019 album <em>Outer Peace</em> was one of life's great coincidences for me, when the stars align and suddenly I have something amazing sitting right in my lap, where moments before there was nothing. Born Chaz Bundick (but now named Chaz Bear) Toro y Moi is (was) mainly a graphic designer who says that he likes to look at music as a hobby, which seems to sum up his generally chill attitude and explains the lightness in his music. Everything about Bundick's songs feels chill, relaxing, and easy-going, no matter the style, which can fluctuate from project to project.</p>
        <p>But back to how this masterpiece came to my attention - in early 2019, G$ posted a video on our music Slack chat of a Toro y Moi song from 2013's R&B and dance flavored <em>Anything in Return</em>. It really impressed me, and the album started getting some heavy rotation in my headphones for the next 24 hours. Only a day later, I saw online that Toro y Moi had just released a brand new album, which was perfect timing for a guy who had just learned about him only 2 days before!</p>
        <p>And I'm so grateful that I DID know who he was so that the blurb regarding the release of <em>Outer Peace</em> jumped out at me. It's a beautiful album, totally different than <em>Anything in Return</em> stylistically in that it moves further away from a more organic 90's sound into a more Daft Punk-esque indie/disco/electronica feel, but with a silliness and lighthearted attitude that makes it as much a bubble gummy future pop record as it does a club set.</p>
        <p>"Baby Drive it Down" fits well into a club scene, but more like the bar upstairs above the basement dance floor. Persistently rhythmic in the vocal line and the driving marimba line, it's also round and warm in tone, truly mellow and chillllllll. It's unlike any song I've ever heard, a sure fire sign that it will be one of my favorites for years to come!</p>
