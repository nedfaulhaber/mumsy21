        <p>Not sure what I can say about Björk after writing a 100+ page thesis on her! Hard to believe that it's almost been more years from my thesis til now (14 years) than it was from Björk's first solo album up until my thesis (15 years). At this point, my thesis only covers half of her career!!</p>
        <p>After doing so much listening, watching, reading, and writing about Björk for 2 years, plus all of the engagement I had with her music prior to any academic stuff, it sort of makes sense that eventually she would fall into the category of an artist that's one of your clear favorites ever, but who you don't really listen to much at all. It's sort of just a given, like the laws of physics or something, that Björk is a genius. Though understandable, the lack of listening to her has led to me not keeping up with any of her more recent material. The last Björk album that I listened to in its entirety was 2011's brilliant <em>Biophilia</em>! This is a habit I plan to break this year. Admittedly, some of the songs that I have overheard from her newer records hasn't been nearly as fantastic as her older material, but I almost owe it to her to give all of the music a chance!</p>
        <p>So why this classic Björk on your mix? Like "II B.S." by Mingus, I have little doubt that this song appeared on a cassette mix for you back in the 90's. This was the second Björk song that I ever heard, and has long held a special place in my heart. For years, I used "Hyperballad" as a means of testing speakers before purchase, including my blue Toyota! Well, again, like so many songs on this mix, we can chalk this up to the kids. I randomly decided to add "Hyperballad" to one of the playlists this summer, not really expecting anything out of it. But Maya and Mo really latched on to it, especially Mo. It was great to see how powerful the song could still be after all of these years (1995 was when it was released, on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/post/300205609" target="_blank">the album <em>Post</em></a>) - even the production holds up. Typically, what sounded huge, warm and booming in the bass synths and beats back in those days sounds relatively thin when placed side by side with today's technology. Maya was particularly impressed at how resonant and big the bass sounded. For Mo, it was the emotion, the crazy lyrics, and the slow build of the song from a stripped down bass and vocal to to a full-on orchestral and techno dance track.</p>
        <p>The most surprising part for me was that Mo submitted this song for the Top 40 for 2021, and it came in second place! Some songs are just timeless, and if anyone can make a song that can last, it's someone who always seems light years ahead of everyone else. So I figured, hey, why not revisit this song on a mix? Close with a classic :).</p>
