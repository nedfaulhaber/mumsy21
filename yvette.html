        <p>About a year and a half ago, the kids and I collaborated on a birthday mix for you that included a song by the San Jose-based math rock group Covet. The group's leader, guitarist Yvette Young, has spent years crafting and fine-tuning an incredible tap-style of guitar playing, a combination of jazzman Stanley Jordan and legendary guitarist and innovator Eddie Van Halen.</p>
        <p>Before forming Covet, Young had been playing music for many years by herself. She began at a young (no pun intended) age, studying piano and violin. While attending college at UC Berkley, she picked up guitar and focused her talents exclusively in that direction, developing the tapping technique that has defined her as an artist since that time.</p>
        <p>In 2009, while living in Los Angeles, she took her virtuosity with the instrument online, garnering followers right and left, and produced a solo album in 2014. Soon after, she moved back to the Bay and formed Covet, moving in a math rock direction (math rock owes a debt to progressive rock but focuses on syncopation and odd time signatures over sweeping production, and is usually instrumental). But in 2019, she made a surprising move back to an early instrument - the piano - to record a solo EP entitled simply <em>Piano</em>. The recording is mainly just Young and a piano, but for the final song (the one here), she brought in Covet drummer Forrest Rice and overdubbed herself playing bass. The result is a fun, "mathy", rhythmically playful masterwork reminiscent of classical minimilasts and progressive rockers alike. Amy says it was my most played song in the household last year - this is partially because I feel it has a universal appeal for all of the picky tastes of my family members, but mostly because it is amazing!</p>
