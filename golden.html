        <p>When you sent me your playlist "Change Gonna Come", I noticed that one of the missing songs was the 1946 recording of No Restricted Signs by the Golden Gate Quartet. The image for the track is one of the four "cover images" for the playlist, and it popped out at me as soon as I opened up the link because I knew that I had put a song by these guys on this mix of yours! What are the odds? Not exactly a household name, the Golden Gate Quartet, at least not to me. You didn't mention it as one of the substitutions or omissions, but I checked the song out anyway and it was a good one!</p>
        <p>I had never heard of these 4 singers until last year. After reading <em>City of Thieves</em>, and then both Maya and Mo reading it as well, I had Stalin and WWII era Russia on my mind. One of the things that struck me about the kids reading that book was that they didn't know much about Stalin. Schools really cover Hitler well, but Stalin and the Cold War seem to get left behind when it comes to school history these days. I saw a unique opportunity for them to learn a "sort of neutral" history of the tyrant and the USSR by discussing <em>City of Thieves</em>, where Russia is battling the Nazis as an ally of ours. Unlike me, where Stalin was a full fledged villain right from the get go of my knowledge of him, they got to see a bigger and more interesting, nuanced story of the man. He and the Russian people were integral in stopping Hitler, and the whole Russian debacle was the turning point of the war. It was great to see the kids get to see the war from a different perspective than just the US versus Hitler, which is always the focus in school. I didn't learn about the incredible importance of the failed invasion of Russia until so much later, probably college!</p>
        <p>That conversation then led to talking about Stalin before and after WWII, his atrocities, the Cold War, the Bolsheviks...it was a really great learning opportunity for them. And all the while, I had this song "Stalin Wasn't Stallin'" playing in my head, which I thought was by an experimental singer by the name of Robert Wyatt - a British artist who was in the psychedelic scene in the late 60's and early 70's as a member of Soft Machine, and then has been making his own uniquely odd music since then. The "Stalin" song is on his 1980 record <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/nothing-can-stop-us/292514004" target="_blank"><em>Nothing Can Stop Us</em></a>, and he does a multi-part harmony with his own voices multi-tracked. So I decided last summer it would be fun to find the song and put it on the monthly family playlist.</p>
        <p>To my total surprise, I discovered that Wyatt's was actually a cover - and the original was done by a quartet of Black singers all the way back in 1943, during the war itself! It was amazing to me how unique a period in US history that was, when an American singing group like the Golden Gate Quartet could make a pro-Communist, pro-Russian, pro-Stalin song and proudly put it out there for all to hear! I love this version, so of its time with the sing songy talking and barbershop feel, and it was so perfect as something to add to the family playlist that month, and add to our whole conversation about WWII and Russia. The three of us listened to the playlist on the way to Wyoming on our road trip and had it stuck in our heads the whole hike - the lyrics of the song are SO SO great! We were singing our Commie propaganda up and down the trails. ;D</p>
