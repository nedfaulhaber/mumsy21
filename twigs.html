        <p>It's always tricky when you make comparisons between artists, especially when talking about a newer generation artist whose work is reminiscent of a previous one. It can sound dismissive to say "so and so is the new so and so", and in the case of English musician FKA twigs, the last thing she deserves is dismissal. But WOW, it's hard not to compare her to Björk. Certainly not identical - twigs' wispy vocals are really far from Björk's elvish belting and Icelandic accent - but in terms of the music and the greater artistic package, the comparison is valid. Her bending of genre, costumery, use of electronics, capability to be both poppy and experimental, and general eccentricity (she says that the FKA are nothing but just capital letters, no acronym) are a few of the things about twigs that are reminiscent of Björk.</p>
        <p> Taliah Barnett (aka FKA, pun intended) was born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire and moved to South London, where she became a backup dancer for major artists' videos like Kylie Minogue and Ed Sheeran. By 2012, she had moved into singing and producing and released her first recording, entitled simply <em>EP1</em>, on bandcamp, with a YouTube video accompanying each track. The EP was noticed by critics, who praised its experimental and trip hoppy approach. By 2014, twigs (a nickname which came to her because her joints crack) had released a second EP and was winning critics' awards in England and getting major publicity in online publications.</p>
        <p>Another EP and a full length album later, twigs was internationally known. Since that time, she has added to her creative arsenal with an expanded knowledge of dance, acting, directing, and the Chinese sword wielding martial art called wushu. She has brought all of this to the stage and to her musical creativity. Her most recent album, 2019's <em>Magdalene</em>, was crafted after she underwent surgery to remove tumors from her uterus. She says that she was inspired by the mythical biblical figure during the experience, and immediately began putting the inspiration to music. The album has a strong feminist bent, even including rapper Future (not exactly known for being "woke" about women), who brought his most tender verse of his career on a song far from his usual trap genre.</p>
        <p>The song "sad day" hit me the way many twigs songs have done before - I was listening to the sonic tableau of her new album and suddenly, out of the experimental and dense harmonies came the most beautiful, catchy melody. On every twigs recording, I have had the same thing happen - twigs' music is decidedly NOT catchy, and then suddenly there will be the most incredible and familiar (relatively speaking) melody/verse/chorus. This song has been with me ever since; I can't get enough of it. Interestingly, the same thing happened to Maya, who was absent mindedly listening to it in the background and then asked me a few days later, "what was that song? I really like that." We were trying to narrow it down to find an answer as to who and what it was, and suddenly it came on the speakers at that very moment! She immediately knew it. Another great example of music demanding to be heard in some cosmic way. A truly twigs-esque moment.</p>
