        <p>Moses Sumney is hard to pin down stylistically, and that's apparently how he likes it. He spent his first years in the music business turning down record label after record label, citing that they were attempting to mold him in the image that they saw him - a black man with an incredible voice, and therefore an R&B singer. Meanwhile, Sumney was searching for something much bigger - an original sound with so many ingredients that in the end, he says that if one word could sum it up, it would be "folk". His idea of folk is a far cry from someone expecting Bob Dylan, however.</p>
        <p>All of this was in LA, where he grew up, but with an all-important 6 years between ages 10 and 16, when he moved back to Ghana with his Ghanaian parents. This period was key in setting him on a different musical path; he found it difficult at the time to live in a rural environment, but later while living as a musician in LA, he would go into the country or wilderness to write his music. Eventually, in 2018, he left LA altogether and moved to Asheville, NC, to escape the music business and its cult of personality. He had already put out critically praised music and toured with huge acts like James Blake, so his move was a surprise to many unless they knew him personally.</p>
        <p>But then again, Sumney's artistry is full of surprises and always has been. Despite having a naturally virtuosic vocal ability, he loves to use vocoders and other electronic effects on his singing when he records, which has confused many of his admirers on the traditional end of his interests, as much as his love of the mountains and solitude has befuddled the more modern set. His music is experimental in nature, definitely not radio friendly, and yet, he'll regularly cite influences that are anything but avant garde, and who are legendarily radio friendly.</p>
        <p>Rapper/singer T-Pain is one of those influences. T-Pain, considered in some ways the first artist to use auto-tune as a stylistic choice, was huge in the 00's, scoring hit after hit and guesting on perhaps one of the biggest radio hits of the entire 21st century, Flo Rida's "Low" in 2008. For anyone close enough to Sumney to understand his interest in vocal effects, and his wide palette of influences, it came as no surprise at all that he would cover T-Pain's hit song "Can't Believe It" in 2021. But in truth, Sumney has in many ways made sure that most people <em>aren't</em> close enough to understand a choice like that. So for quite a few of his more avant-garde loving fans, this was a bit of a shocker</p>
        <p>Saxophonist/electronic music producer Sam Gendel's presence on the cover probably surprised some of his fans as well. As a superbly virtuosic saxophonist in the jazz world, and a sophisticated producer who pushes the boundaries of that often suffocating culture, Gendel doesn't seem like the type to cover a T-Pain hit. But again, looks can be deceiving, and Gendel's association with Thundercat, the Grammy-winning bass player who has played with everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Kamasi Washington to metal band Suicidal Tendencies, should be enough to help folks realize that his tastes probably span much more than experimental jazz. <img class="sam" src="img/samgendel.png" alt="Sam Gendel lays his head against a rusty fence"> Recently, all evidence is pointing to the fact that Gendel is also part of a decidedly non-jazz "grindcore" duo known as Clown Core, whose two members (who always appear in clown makeup) have never revealed their true identities (Gendel claims that he's never even heard of Clown Core). With all that in mind, it makes sense that Gendel would collaborate with another enigmatic guy like Sumney to cover T-Pain!</p>
        <p>The track itself is in ways pretty true to the original; the groove and vibe, and Sumney's vocal rhythms, make the song totaly recognizable. But then, there is the washed out, wispy, production and heavily effected saxophones and vocals. The song at times sounds like it's being played backwards to me! And Sumney's vocal solo at the end sounds as much like a synth or one of Gendel's saxophones as it does like a voice.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite things about the song are the funny and clever T-Pain lyrics. T-Pain is a pretty nerdy guy, despite being a rap star, and his image was more like an over-the-top P-Funker than a rapper. Overall, he was (and is) decidedly un-sexy, which is what made this song's theme really work. T-Pain imagines a Pretty Woman style scenario where he "saves" a dancer at a strip club and lavishes riches and romance upon her, but only after he discovers that this impossibly beautiful woman actually has a thing for him and doesn't just want his money. It's unclear in the original whether T-Pain's narrator is actually talking with her or whether the whole thing is in his head, but either way, he "can't believe" that this dancer would be into him. G$ made an astute observation when he heard Sumney's version - with Sumney being so sexy, it seems likely that the whole thing is very much real, not just imaginary. There seems to be no question that with a guy who looks like Sumney, a dancer would leave her job, become his wife, and travel the world with him, right then and there. G$ suggested perhaps this version should be called "Can Believe It"!</p>
