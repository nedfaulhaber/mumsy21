        <p>2020, of course, saw the passing of Neil Peart. I can't really say enough about his influence on my life. I might've never become a bass player were it not for that night that I first heard Rush. I remember it like yesterday, lying in bed on a hot summer night with my walkman and pressing play. What I heard simply blew my mind. The precision with which these guys played their instruments was off the charts. Neil's drumming especially jumped out at me. I'm not sure if you recall this, but I wanted to be a drummer first and foremost, but Schlaps was already one and he wanted to form a band. So I picked up the next rhythm instrument in line, the bass, and the rest is history. In a sense, without Neil Peart, my life path may have been completely different.</p>
        <p>I also remember his essays that accompanied the Rush booklets you could get at a live show. He had one for every album and every tour. Mine was from <em>Presto</em>. When Deborah and I were just beginning to date, I wrote an inspired piece for her that I essentially lifted from Neil, regarding the beauty of snow! She was so enamored with it that she asked for more, and I was forced to strike forward on my own. I think I wrote another 3 such pieces, and though they were more original, they were still thematically based in those Neil Peart essays.</p>
        <p>As a farewell to this musical genius, I thought it only fitting that the last song on your mix should be a Rush encore staple. Hearing Geddy yell out "Thank you! Goodnight!" to the crowd is not only appropriate for Rush saying goodbye and Neil saying goodbye. It's also what I am saying to him. Here's a small gallery I compiled of him throughout the years:
