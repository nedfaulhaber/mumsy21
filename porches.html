        <p>The name "Porches" is a lot like "Bon Iver"; sometimes, it is referred to as the alter ego of the artist, used as an individual moniker, much like Drake. But then again, Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and Aaron Maine (Porches) are sometimes mentioned as the leaders of a band entitled Bon Iver or Porches. It can get confusing; personally I see both of these guys as being interchangeable with their project names. In the end, they are the masterminds behind every bit of the music. So when I refer to Porches, I'm going to be talking very singly about Mr. Aaron Maine, of Pleasantville, NY.</p>
        <p>Porches, Maine's most popular project among a few, was introduced to me by someone at work a few years ago. What struck me immediately about Maine's music was that very special combination of amazing pop sensibility and a "punk" edge, and when I say punk, I could be speaking of "new wave" or "college radio" music from the 80's. Essentially, there is a musicianship and songwriting ability that would surpass a punk group such as The Ramones or The Sex Pistols, but the spirit of saying "hey, who cares if I'm not classically trained? I can do this thing!" is ultra-important to the style. This often plays out in simple patterns, chords, and instrumental parts, and perhaps most notably in the vocals. Bands like The Cure or New Order, for instance, have epic emotional content and sweepingly beautiful music, but with a decidedly un-pro, un-polished approach and with vocals that sometimes only a mother (or a fan) would love.</p>
        <p>"Lipstick Song" is a perfect example. The song drips with emotion, the sounds are perfect, the harmonies beautiful, but Maine's vocals are anything but polished, and the instrumental parts are stripped down in a way that feels like a college kid in a dorm room could play them. But finding a college kid who could write a song like this...good luck. It's not an everyday thing, but importantly, music like Maine's makes it feel attainable. It isn't intimidating, like going to music school or drilling complicated riffs over and over. And truth be told, if you have the songwriting ability, Maine proves that you don't need to spend years and years training to make beautiful, approachable, excellent music.</p>
        <p>One last thing about this song. In late 2020, Amy heard me playing it in the kitchen one day and asked "Why haven't you put this song on a family playlist yet??" She ended up doing it that very month, and "Lipstick Song", thanks to her, ended up in the Top 40 on our New Years Eve countdown. I'm excited to say that a little over a year later, I get to put this song on a playlist! :)</p>
